# DEBUG
Building a small/simplicity focused linux debugger because I'm tired of GDB.

TODO:
- Render a nice looking GUI
- Handle simple user-defined C expressions

DONE:
- Parse ELF debug symbols so breakpoints can be set semantically

Using stb_truetype.h, SDL2, and ProggyClean
Hopefully long-term I'll be using my own font/window rendering code, but for now those'll get me moving
